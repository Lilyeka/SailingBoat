# SailingBoat

I have a small view (self.boat), located near the top-right corner of the screen, whose layer contents are a picture of a sailboat facing to the left. I’ll “sail” the boat in a curving path, both down the screen and left and right across the screen, like an extended letter “S”. Each time the boat comes to a vertex of the curve, changing direction across the screen, I’ll flip the boat so that it faces the way it’s about to move. At the same time, I’ll constantly rock the boat, so that it always appears to be pitching a little on the waves.
